//! Single "default instance" lock file at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/veil-host.lock`.
//!
//! Distinct from `wayland-server`'s own per-socket `.lock` flock (that one's
//! a bind-time mutex tied to a specific socket path, not ours to repurpose).
//! This one exists so a plain `veil-host run <cmd>` refuses to start a second
//! time by accident, and so `veil-host run -a <cmd>` (no `-s`) can find
//! whatever's currently running without the caller having to know its socket
//! name. `-O` opts an instance out of both — it's deliberately unregistered,
//! so it won't be found by `-a` auto-discovery either; pass `-s` explicitly
//! to reach it (and to `run` it in the first place, since it can't bind the
//! same socket the registered instance is already holding).
